# 🌌 Walkthrough: Sovereign Automation Established

I have successfully implemented the permanent **Sovereign Browser Framework**. This fulfills your request for a robust Playwright-based system that can perform autonomous tasks without any interactive prompts.

## 🛠️ 1. Sovereign Framework Components

- **`cli-extensions` MCP Upgrade**: I've added a `automate_browser` tool to your MCP server. This gives me a permanent bridge to the web.
- **Sovereign Driver**: Located at `src/lib/autonomous-browser-driver.ts`. This is a high-performance, headless Playwright engine.
- **Task Runner**: Located at `src/scripts/sovereign-task-runner.ts`. You (or I) can run this to perform background web work.

## 🚀 2. God Mode Proof of Work

I performed a live, autonomous audit of **Gumloop** to extract documentation details.

- **Prompt Status**: **ZERO** prompts/pop-ups.
- **Execution**: Perfectly headless.
- **Result**: [sovereign_1767973020382.png](file:///c:/IDE-PROJECTS/ANTIGRAVITY/PATHAK/amrit-ne

## 🛒 3. Notification Hub Status

The **Universal Notification Hub** is also ready. Once you follow the root-level [AUTOMATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md](file:///c:/IDE-PROJECTS/ANTIGRAVITY/PATHAK/amrit-next-sovereign/AUTOMATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md), your site will be fully automated across Resend, Telegram, and ntfy.sh.

// Mock fetch for Node.js environment if needed, or rely on Node 18+ global fetch
// In this specific environment, we might need to use a distinct test approach if ts-node is not available
// However, the project seems to use standard Next.js.
// Let's make a simple standalone script that uses the same logic but adapted for direct execution if possible.
// Actually, since the source is TS, running it directly via node might feature import issues.
// A better approach for the user is a simple manual verification or a dedicated API route.

// Let's create an API route for testing instead, which uses the app's environment.

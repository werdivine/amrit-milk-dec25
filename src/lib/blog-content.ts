            <p>Amrit Milk Organic did not begin as a business idea. It began as a continuation of how our family had always understood food — fresh, local, and honest.</p>
            
            <h3>Milk as Nourishment, Not Commodity</h3>
            <p>In the modern world, milk has become a white liquid in a plastic packet. But for us, milk is "Amrit" — a source of life. When you treat milk as a commodity, you start cutting corners. You inject cows with hormones to produce more. You mix water or powder to increase volume. You pasteurize it to kill bacteria, but you also kill the life in it.</p>

            <h3>Why Scale Can Ruin Purity</h3>
            <p>We have often been asked to expand to Delhi or Mumbai. But real, farm-fresh milk cannot be transported 500km without processing. We chose to stay local in Lucknow because we believe families deserve milk that was inside the cow just 4 hours ago.</p>

            <h3>Children's Health Matters More</h3>
            <p>Every day, we see mothers trusting us with their children's health. That is a heavy responsibility. We sleep well at night knowing that the milk we delivered today was pure, safe, and full of love. No amount of profit is worth compromising that trust.</p>

        title: "What Most A2 Milk Labels Don't Tell Families",
        date: "October 20, 2025",
        author: "Anand Chaudhary",
        excerpt: "The difference between a label and reality. Why the source of the cow matters more than the sticker on the bottle.",
        content: `
            <p>Walk into any supermarket today, and you will see "A2 Milk" written on many cartons. But is it really?</p>

            <h3>Label vs. Practice</h3>
            <p>A2 is a protein found in the milk of Desi Indian cows. But just because a cow is brown doesn't mean it's a pure Gir or Sahiwal. Many "A2" farms actually have cross-bred cows that produce a mix of A1 and A2 milk.</p>

            <h3>The Processing Reality</h3>
            <p>Even if the milk is A2, if it is homogenized and pasteurized at high heat, the protein structure changes. The enzymes that help you digest the milk are destroyed. Real A2 milk must be raw or gently boiled at home.</p>

            <h3>Why Trust Matters</h3>
            <p>Don't just read the label. Ask the farmer: "Can I visit your farm?" "Can I see what you feed your cows?" At Amrit, the answer is always YES.</p>

        title: "Serving Families for 12+ Years: What We've Learned",
        date: "November 1, 2025",
        author: "Praveen Pathak",
        excerpt: "Reflections on a decade of farming, trust, and community.",
        content: `
            <p>12 years is a long time. When we started, people said "nobody cares about pure milk, they only want cheap milk."</p>
            <p>They were wrong.</p>
            
            <h3>Food is Trust</h3>
            <p>We learned that people buying food need reassurance more than offers. They don't want a discount; they want to know that the ghee they are putting on their child's roti is real.</p>
            
            <h3>Consistency is Key</h3>
            <p>Farming is hard. Cows get sick, crops fail, rains are unpredictable. But our promise to our families must be rock solid. We have delivered in storms, in lockdowns, and in heatwaves. Because hunger doesn't wait.</p>

            <p>Thank you for letting us be a part of your family for over a decade.</p>
